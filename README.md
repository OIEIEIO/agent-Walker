# Reinforcement Learning Training Framework

## 1. Trainer

The **Trainer** is a custom-built framework designed to facilitate the training of reinforcement learning models. It is responsible for managing the entire training process, including data collection, model updates, checkpointing, and logging.

### Key Features:

- **Training Loop**: The core of the trainer is the loop that interacts with the environment to collect experiences and updates the model parameters based on those experiences.
- **Environment Interaction**: The trainer interacts with the environment (e.g., `BipedalWalker-v3`), collecting observations, rewards, and other relevant data.
- **Policy and Value Networks**: The trainer manages two neural networks:
  - **Policy Network**: Determines the actions to take based on the observed states.
  - **Value Network**: Estimates the value of a given state, helping to compute the advantages for the policy update.
- **Optimizer Management**: The trainer uses optimizers (e.g., Adam) to adjust the model parameters based on the gradients computed from the training data.
- **Checkpointing**: Regularly saves the model's state (policy and value networks) and optimizer states, allowing the training to resume from a checkpoint if needed.
- **Metrics Logging**: Collects and logs various training metrics, such as rewards, loss values, and optimizer states, which are useful for evaluating the model's performance over time.

## 2. Model

The **Model** consists of the neural networks (policy and value networks) that are being trained to solve the reinforcement learning task.

### Key Components:

- **Policy Network**:
  - This network is responsible for selecting actions based on the current state of the environment.
  - It outputs either discrete actions (using softmax) or continuous actions (using mean and standard deviation) depending on the action space of the environment.
- **Value Network**:
  - This network estimates the value of being in a particular state, which is used to compute the advantage for updating the policy.
- **Architecture**:
  - The networks are typically composed of multiple layers, such as fully connected layers, with activations like ReLU, to enable the model to learn complex functions.
  - The specific architecture (e.g., hidden layers with sizes `[64, 128, 256]`) is designed based on the complexity of the task.

## 3. Checkpoints

**Checkpoints** are saved snapshots of the model and optimizer states at specific intervals during training. They allow you to resume training or evaluate the model from a particular point in time.

### Key Features:

- **Regular Saving**: The trainer saves checkpoints at regular intervals (e.g., every 200 epochs).
- **Resumption**: Training can be resumed from any checkpoint, enabling long-running tasks to be split into multiple sessions.
- **Best Models**: You can save and later use the best-performing models based on specific criteria like cumulative rewards.

## 4. Metrics Logging and Visualization

**Metrics** are logged throughout the training process to monitor the performance and behavior of the model.

### Key Components:

- **TensorBoard Integration**: Metrics are logged to TensorBoard, allowing for real-time visualization of the training process, including losses, rewards, and more.
- **Plotly Visualizations**: Additional visualizations are created using Plotly, enabling detailed analysis of specific metrics like joint angles, hull velocities, and optimizer norms.
- **Video Rendering**: You can render videos of the agent's performance with overlays showing real-time metrics, providing a visual understanding of how the model is performing during training.

## 5. Model Variability and Configuration

The framework is flexible and allows for different models and training configurations to be used. For example:

- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: The main algorithm currently used for training, which balances exploration and exploitation by constraining policy updates.
- **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)**: Another RL algorithm that could be integrated into the framework, providing options for different learning paradigms.
- **Hyperparameters**: Various hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and network architecture can be tuned to optimize the model's performance.

## 6. Google Drive Integration

The framework is integrated with Google Drive for storing checkpoints, videos, and other outputs, ensuring that your work is securely backed up and accessible across different sessions.

## Summary

In summary, you've built a comprehensive **Reinforcement Learning Training Framework** that includes a robust trainer, flexible model architecture, efficient checkpointing, and detailed metrics logging and visualization. The system is designed for flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for experimenting with different models, training strategies, and reinforcement learning algorithms.
